    <div class="text1 texts">Pollution is now a common place term, that our ears are attuned to. We
        hear about the various forms of pollution and read about it through the
        mass media. Air pollution is one such form that refers to the contamination
        of the air, irrespective of indoors or outside. A physical, biological or
        chemical alteration to the air in the atmosphere can be termed as pollution.
        It occurs when any harmful gases, dust, smoke enters into the atmosphere
        and makes it difficult for plants, animals and humans to survive as
        the air becomes dirty.<br><br>
        “Air pollution is one of the biggest threats for the environment and affects
        everyone: humans, animals, crops, cities, forests, aquatic ecosystems”</div>

    <div class="text2 texts">Burning of Fossil Fuels: Sulfur dioxide emitted from the combustion of
        fossil fuels like coal, petroleum and other factory combustibles is one the
        major cause of air pollution. Pollution emitting from vehicles including
        trucks, jeeps, cars, trains, airplanes cause immense amount of pollution.
        We rely on them to fulfill our daily basic needs of transportation. But, there
        overuse is killing our environment as dangerous gases are polluting the
        environment. Carbon Monooxide caused by improper or incomplete combustion
        and generally emitted from vehicles is another major pollutant
        along with Nitrogen Oxides, that is produced from both natural and man
        made processes.</div>

    <div class="text3 texts">Manufacturing industries
        release large
        amount of carbon monoxide,
        hydrocarbons,
        organic compounds,
        and chemicals into the
        air thereby depleting
        the quality of air. Manufacturing
        industries can
        be found at every
        corner of the earth and
        there is no area that
        has not been affected
        by it. Petroleum refineries
        also release hydrocarbons
        and various
        other chemicals that
        pollute the air and also
        cause land pollution.

    <div class="text4 texts">Mining is a process where in minerals below the earth are extracted using
        large equipments. During the process dust and chemicals are released in
        the air causing massive air pollution. This is one of the reason which is
        responsible for the deteriorating health conditions of workers and nearby
        residents.<br><br>As the meter goes up, It is impossible to
        describe the whole extent of potential and
        actual damage caused by all forms of air
        pollution. are you taking Notes of
        how the future might become with all this
        going on?

    <div class="text5 texts">Household cleaning products and Daily Chemicals are a major factor,
        Also,Suspended particulate matter popular by its acronym SPM, is another
        cause of pollution. Referring to the particles afloat in the air, SPM is usually
        caused by dust, combustion etc.

    <div class="text6 texts">Increase in C02 has a major impact on the process of plant evolution by
        preventing photosynthesis in many cases, with serious consequences for
        the purification of the air we breathe. It also contributes to the formation of
        acid rain, atmospheric precipitations in the form of rain, frost, snow or fog,
        which are released during the combustion of fossil fuels and transformed
        by contact with water steam in the atmosphere.

    <div class="text7 texts">Although us as humans are responsible for the increase in carbon dioxide,
        Our continual exposure to air pollutants is responsible for the deterioration
        of human health.<br><br>
        Air pollution is indeed a significant risk factor for human health conditions,
        causing allergies, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as lung
        damage.

        <div class="solutions">
            <h2>Possible Solutions</h2>
            <h4>Eco-friendly transportation</h4>Shifting to electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles, and promoting shared mobility (i.e carpooling, and public transports) could reduce air pollution.
            <h4>Energy conservation and efficiency</h4>Producing clean energy is crucial. But equally important is to reduce our consumption of energy by adopting responsible habits and using more efficient devices.
            <h4>Green building</h4>From planning to demolition, green building aims to create environmentally responsible and resource-efficient structures to reduce their carbon footprint
